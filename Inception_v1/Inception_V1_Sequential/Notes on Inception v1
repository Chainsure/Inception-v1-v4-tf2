GoogLeNet in Keras


It is the commandline-stype sequentual model of GoogLeNet Inception v1. It was originally written in
Theano. However, it can be used in TensorFlow 2.3 with the code switch. The plain model is used for
the thorough study on how Google has build the network based on the network depth of AlexNet and the 
small filter size of NIN(Network In Network). It typically stacks the layers for more the complex 
expression of the image classification. 
GoogLeNet paper:

Concerns: 

1.Total size of parameters

It is quite strange that the Inception v1 has The size of total parameters is 13+ million that is far 
more than the official number of 5+ million. Please see the paper with opening the weblink as follows.
It is worth mentioning that Francios Chollt has make the GoogLeNet Inception v3 with 23+ million 
parameters that is much less than the original total parameters.

2. Thenao and TensorFlow Platforms 

It supports both Theano and TensorFlow. Therefore, it requires the selection of channels_first for 
both the platforms. 

3. Slection of channels_first

# Open the file of keras.jsopn
$ ~/.keras/keras.json

# Change "channels_last" to "channels_first" in the third parameter

{
    "floatx": "float32",
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "backend": "tensorflow",
    "image_data_format": "channels_first"
}
Running the Demo (googlenet.py)
To create a GoogLeNet model, call the following from within Python:

Thanks for the guys for the contributions. joelouismarino provided the original script of the model and
swghosh modified the script of lrn.py based on the original scrip of joelouismarino. Mike modifies it 
to adatp to TensorFlow 2.3 and Keras 2.4.3
