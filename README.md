# Inception-v1-v4

It is an attempt to have the new interpretation of the classical Inception v1~v4 models in the new
environment. The new interpreted models are used for the thorough study on how the outstanding 
creators and developers has build the classical network based on the network depth of AlexNet and 
the small filter size of NIN(Network In Network). It typically stacks the layers for more the complex 
expression of the image classification. 

# Environment

## Ununtu 18.04 
## TensorFlow 2.2 
## Keras 2.4.3
## CUDA Toolkit 11.0
## cuDNN 8.0.1
## CUDA 450.57

# Others

Thanks for the all the creators, developers and editors who make the contributions to the widespread 
application in the image recognition related industries. The classical models work both either the
tools ans inheritance that enrich the people's lives.
